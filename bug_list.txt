zoom
====
- optimize scroll recording  only need to fetch effective content area once per URL
- scroll recording might be reporting last timestamp of the scroll (mild)
- flush typing event and reset it if mouse down or scroll are detected
- test perfomance with large videos (specially zoom calculations)
- deal with mouse going outside of the viewport in window mode


Recording
=========
- don't accept events until recording starts
- add extensions open close time as events
- add blur open and done events....
- figure out how to do UI for auto cut sections


core
====
- GIF export
- Confirm Peremissions dialog is working well and deal if user reject it
- video size export options

v2:

- Support adding screens in the middle of the recording
- Option to blur components.



UX 
==== 
- timeline selector that way you can delete parts of multiple windows or create GIF
- window selector (maybe same as timeline selector) won't work for speed.
- Product walk through
- Collapse Windows view
- Project Selector
- AutoZoom options / Zoom options

SETTINGS
========
- Projects (name(rename), delete, open, duration, thumbnail?, creation date, last modified date) total storage used. potenitally storage used alert to delete some projects to free up space.


- Camera (location, full size, square, circle, roundness, frame)
- Effects (only if there is UserEvents) (mouse clicks(color, shape, size, on/off), keyboard(top, down, (on/off)), zoom, auto-zoom settings.)



- deactivate logger in production
- remove unused logs and switch everything else to logger behdind DEV/PROD flags
