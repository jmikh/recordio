- optimize scroll recording  only need to fetch effective content area once per URL
- scroll recording might be reporting last timestamp of the scroll
- add zoom based on URL change (should proably start zooming out after the url change)
- test perfomance with large videos (specially zoom calculations)
- text box bounds should be take into account when in focus
- use viewport-must and viewport-preferred in zoom calculations. if viewport-must all fit in last viewport then don't change it, if not then use viewport-preferred. Scroll > Click > Editing > Hover.
